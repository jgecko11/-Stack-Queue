A Queue can be simulated using two Stacks: one for enqueuing and one for dequeuing. Remember that Stacks are first in last out data structures, while Queues are first in first out.

Use this understanding to develop: the StackQueue!

 

Assignment Instructions

With a random partner, you will be creating a StackQueue - a Queue that is made up of two Stacks (and not QueueNodes). You will likely find your Stack class useful here, so take some time together to decide which partner's code you'd like to use.

Please submit the assignment via a link to Github, your repo should be a DIFFERENT REPO than your Queue/Stack repositories.
